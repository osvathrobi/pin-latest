# pin-latest

```bash
npx pin-latest
```

```bash
yarn global add pin-latest
```

```json
{
    "name": "example-project",
    "dependencies": {
        "pin-latest": "latest"
    }
}
```

After running pin-latest in the same directory as the above file, you are left with:

```json
{
    "name": "example-project",
    "dependencies": {
        "pin-latest": "^0.0.1"
    }
}
```
